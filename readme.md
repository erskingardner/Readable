## A simple node.js app that runs on port 8000 and parses urls for readability. ##

  http://localhost:8000/?url=http://therealdeal.com/newyork/articles/35528
  
The actual readability engine is a clone of the very handy arrix/node-readability with lots of small changes and tweaks for our individual environment.
